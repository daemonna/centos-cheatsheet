# Install MLS

```
yum install selinux-policy-mls policycoreutilsÂ­python
```

set policy to permissive in /etc/selinux/config

```
SELINUX=permissive

SELINUXTYPE=mls
```

Create the .autorelabel file in root's home directory to ensure that files are relabeled upon next reboot

```
touch /.autorelabel
```

If there were no denial messages in **/var/log/messages**, or you have resolved all existing denials, configure SELINUX=enforcing in the /etc/selinux/config file

```
SELINUX=enforcing
```

Reboot your system and make sure SELinux is running in permissive mode

```
getenforce
```

and the MLS policy is enabled

```
sestatus |grep mls
```
